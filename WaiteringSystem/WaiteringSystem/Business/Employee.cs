          An employee has an employee number/ID and a role at the restaurant. 
          Since there are different types of employees with different ROLES in a restaurant, 
          we will create a Role class. Three derived classes (headwaiter, waiter and runner) 
          that inherit the role class will be created first 
          (We can say that a waiter IS A specific role an employee might have in the restaurant, etc.).
          The headwaiter has only salary as a data member. The runner and the waiter have the following attributes: 
          tips, rate and noOfShifts. For now do not include the constructor for these classes. 
          Implement the classes, observing OOP principles. Include encapsulation principles.   */
